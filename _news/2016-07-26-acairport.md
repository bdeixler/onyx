Onyx Renewable Partners L.P. ("Onyx"), a leader in the development and finance of commercial and industrial ("C&I") and small scale utility solar projects in North American markets, today announced that it has been awarded the contract from the South Jersey Transportation Authority ("SJTA") to construct, own and operate photovoltaic solar arrays at Atlantic City International Airport.  The final design will be completed through a coordinated effort between Onyx and SJTA staff in order to maximize the size of the system.  "The Onyx team has significant prior experience with constructing solar facilities on or near airports, including the first of its kind at Newark Liberty International Airport in 2012.  We are pleased to bring that expertise to South Jersey and add another international airport to our resume" says Matt Rosenblum, CEO of Onyx.  "The opportunity to work with the SJTA to further their green initiatives is particularly rewarding.  It is a small contribution we can make toward the collective effort to make Atlantic City International Airport more competitive and successful."  The new Onyx owned system will be approximately 5.7MW and designed with an objective to off-set more than 90% of the SJTA electrical load at the airport.

"The South Jersey Transportation Authority looks forward to the public/private partnership with Onyx and their project to help us utilize renewable energy resources to directly lower our operating costs," said Mr. Timothy Kroll, Deputy Airport Director for the Atlantic City International Airport.
