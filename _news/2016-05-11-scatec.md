New York, NY --— Onyx Renewable Partners L.P., a leader in the development and finance of commercial and industrial ("C&I") and small scale utility solar projects in North American markets, today announced that it has acquired the U.S. utility solar team formerly with Norway developer Scatec Solar. The new Onyx team members will continue to operate out of the former Scatec Solar offices in Sausalito, CA giving Onyx an immediate presence on the West Coast. "Our strategic plan to grow utility scale solar development required both a West Coast presence and the on-boarding of a proven team in the space" says Matt Rosenblum, CEO of Onyx. "The opportunity to bring over the entire former U.S. Scatec Solar team gives us immediate ability to meet those strategic objectives and hit the ground running". The new Onyx utility scale solar team will be led by Luigi Resta and has already identified eleven (11) projects for development totaling over 1.2GW.
