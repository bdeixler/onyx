# News Help

You are in the news folder! This is where you can add, edit, or delete articles in the site's "News" page.

All articles here are written in basic Markdown in the main text field. You can change the date in the metadata and also include "About" blurbs, describing the Onyx partners that are mentioned in the news article.

All of these blurbs come from Markdown files in the "partners" folder. If you don't see the company you are looking for in the dropdown menu, just add a new file describing it to the "partners" folder. Once you've commited that, it should be available to you in the dropdown menu. Be sure to save your work (as an unpublished draft) before navigating to another folder!
