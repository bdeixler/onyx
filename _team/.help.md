# Team Help

You are in the team folder! This is where you can add, edit, or delete bios for members of the Onyx team.

Each bio is written in basic Markdown in the main text field. The file name should be the name of the person you are writing about. You can edit their job title in the metadata.

The first line of each bio should contain a link to that team member's headshot (if they have one). **_Putting this anywhere other than the first line will mess up the formatting!_** To add a link to a headshot, click on the images icon in your toolbar. Here, you will be able to select a previously-uploaded headshot or upload your own.

If you add a new bio to the team folder, ***it will not display on the site until you add that member's name to the team.yml file in the data folder.*** The order in which the member bios will appear on the main site is also controlled by that data file. The order of names you see there will be the order of bios on the site's team page. Refer to the data folder .help.md file for more information.
