# Careers Help

You are in the careers folder! This is where you can add, edit, or delete job listings.

If you look at any file, you'll notice that it's completely empty! That's because careers files are *entirely metadata.* Click on the metadata icon to your right, and you'll find a form that divides all the information for this particular job into seperate text fields. Write your job listing there; anything you write in the main text area will not be read by the website.

To write a bullet-pointed list, just begin each line with "- " (minus quotation marks).
