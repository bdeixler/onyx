# Data Help

You are in the data folder! Here you can edit data files used by the site to sort your content.

Data files are the only ones *not* written in Markdown. They are written in YAML, which is used elsewhere as Markdown metadata. As such, dashes no longer indicate an unordered list but an *array*; each dash **must** be the first charachter on a new line and followed by a space. Line breaks in between elements will break the array. Removing the dashes from any file will break the array.

The elements of the team.yml array are case-insensitve, but spelling does matter; a misspelled name will not display on the site. The spelling of each name in the array (including spaces) must match the spelling of their name in the title of their bio, located in the team folder.

Adding new files to this folder will do nothing. Deleting files may break certain aspects of the site.
