Corvias Group is a privately-owned company that strives to tackle tough, large-scale challenges through trusted partnerships that put client interests first; focus more on performance than profit; and, produce sustainable long-term solutions. Three business divisions deliver our mission of Living Made Better – Corvias Military Living, Corvias Campus Living and Corvias Solutions. We work on behalf of the U.S. military, colleges and universities, and public sector agencies to develop tailored solutions that remedy some of America’s most challenging deficiencies in infrastructure and facilities caused by chronic underinvestment. All Corvias Group companies are governed by three core principles: Be the best provider of service; be the best place to work; and, generously give back to the communities where we live and serve. Corvias (kor-vee-us) Group is headquartered in East Greenwich, R.I. [www.corvias.com](http://www.corvias.com/).
