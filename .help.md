# Main Help File

Hi! Welcome to prose.io! This is where you can edit the content of your site or add new content and post it online. All files (including this one) are formatted in Markdown, a simple syntax designed to convert easy-to-write plain text into web-readable HTML.

The buttons in your toolbar will help your format text the way you want, but keep in mind that it's not the *buttons* that do anything, it's the *charachters* (like the asterisk and underscore) that change the way the text will be read and displayed. All these syntax rules are available [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). If you're feeling fancy or need something particular, you can even write in-line HTML.

Most Markdown files will also contain **metadata**, which includes special information like the title and date. You can view the metadata for any file by clicking on the metadata icon on the right of the screen. Try it now!

When you are finished editting a file, click on the save icon to open up the commit panel. In the text box, summarize the changes you just made (i.e. "wrote news article" or "fixed typo"), then click commit. This will update or add the file to the GitHub repository and rebuild the site automatically.

While prose.io generally saves your content to the browser cache, I *highly recommend* that you use a seperate, local text editor when writing large posts or files. If your computer dies or the page refreshes, you may lose all of your progress (this is especially risky on mobile devices). Keep in mind that you can also save a version of your file *without* posting it on the site by making sure the "Published" option in your toolbar is unchecked.

You are currently in the root directory of the Onyx website. As you can see, the site is divided into folder. Each folder contains a different type of content, and files created in that folder will be read differently by the website, just in virtue of their location. If you are wondering how to work with any particular type of file, checkout the .help.md file located in that folder.

Best of luck and happy writing!
